# squeak
After 12 hours and 36 minutes, a sleepless night, and intense CAD, I present my custom mouse case for Project Squeak! With barely any experience in CAD, I rush to join the ranks of those who have. With Project Squeak, the first mouse I'll have is the first mouse I'll design.

**MOST UPDATED FILE:**
more user friendly squeak.stl

**OLD DESIGN:**
<img src = "https://github.com/emilypancake/squeak/blob/main/project%20squeak.png?raw=true" alt = "old image of squeak, a custom mouse designed by me">

**NEW DESIGN:**
<img src = "https://github.com/emilypancake/squeak/blob/main/new%20squeak.png?raw=true" alt = "new image of squeak, a custom mouse designed by me. new image has rounded corners for comfort while keeping the flat design">
